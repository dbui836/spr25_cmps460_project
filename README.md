# spr25_cmps460_project

The project directory is broken up between frontend and backend code. 

Backend:

In the backend, there are two directories, api and testFile. api contains all the main php code divided into appropriate subfolders. The connect_db.php code is in this file. testFile contains initial scripts used to create the database and other miscellaneous scripts.

Frontend:

In the frontend, you'll find most of the relevant code under angular-frontend/src/app/..

We organized the relevant components and services under appropriately named folders.

To run the code, first run xampp and the database server. Next, navigate to angular-frontend and run the command 'ng serve'. The app should run on localhost:4200
